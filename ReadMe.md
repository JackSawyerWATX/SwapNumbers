The print statements look complex because of the addition of "\n" to add line breaks to the output.

This is a 3 variable swap, putting the input into the first two seperate boxes, with an empty box to hold integers while they are being shifted into their new positions.

I have added a 2 variable swap, just using x & y variables. They're not encapsulated. They're 2 seperate programs.
